# Word Seek Puzzle

## Description:
This project is an application implementing an algorithm that can solve a word search puzzle in any direction. Unlike conventional word searches, which find words in specific directions (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal), this algorithm locates the first letter and explores in all surrounding directions to find the entire word.

You can try the application in production here: [word-seek](https://word-seek.lvirrueta.dev)
